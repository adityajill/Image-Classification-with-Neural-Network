# Image-Classification-with-Neural-Network

* All the functions are manually written with out using the tensorflow and keras to learn methodology and how deep network is Implemented.
It is a part of project done in deep neural network course by COURSERA.

In this repository:

•	Implemented a Deep Learning methodology to build an image classification model using neural network by working on derivatives of the cost which are used to update parameters and minimize the cost function.

•	Improvised the accuracy to 82% from 68%(Logistic) by performing forward and backward propagations manually to understand the key computations underlying deep learning and the role of hyperparameters in deep learning.
