# Image-Classification-with-Neural-Network
Implemented a Deep Learning methodology to build an image classification model using neural network by working on derivatives of the cost which are used to update parameters and minimize the cost function. Improvised the accuracy to 82% from 68%(Logistic) by performing forward and backward propagations manually to understand the key computations underlying deep learning and the role of hyper-parameters in deep learning. Techniques Used - Neural Networks, Logistic Regression. (Python)
